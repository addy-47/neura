## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap (Detailed Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Planning & Ideation**

- Define MVP features:

  - Chat interface with AI agent
  - Sphere-based animated assistant
  - Mood detection from input
  - Macro system (custom memory rules)
  - OAuth access to online presence (Gmail, Spotify, etc.)

**Manual Work:**

- Brainstorm core macros to preload
- Define mood-color mappings
- Draft onboarding and consent UX

**Tool:** Figma + Notion
**AI Agent:** Lovable (UI prototyping), Cursor (coding workspace)

---

### **Step 2: UI/UX Prototyping**

- Use **Lovable** to design:

  - Splash screen
  - Chat screen layout with animated sphere placeholder
  - Macro setup screen
  - Mood and memory dashboard

**Manual Work:**

- Create wireframes and flow diagrams
- Export component hierarchy for implementation

---

### **Step 3: 3D Sphere (Zuzu-style)**

**Tool:** React-Three-Fiber (R3F), Drei helpers, Tailwind for layout

- Create mood-reactive 3D sphere using R3F
- Add emotion-based animations: pulse, glow, shake
- Set state triggers from AI emotion predictions

**Manual Work:**

- Design and fine-tune mood animations
- Map moods to color/shape changes

---

### **Step 4: Backend & Auth Setup**

**Tech:** Firebase Auth + Firestore

- Set up user auth (email + Google sign-in)
- Create Firestore schema:

  - `/users/{uid}/macros`
  - `/users/{uid}/chats`
  - `/users/{uid}/preferences`

**Manual Work:**

- Schema design and rules
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

---

### **Step 5: AI Personalization Engine**

**AI Tool:**

- OpenAI GPT-4.5 (chat engine)
- Pinecone (vector DB for memory)
- LangChain (prompt chaining, context loading)

**Tasks:**

- Create user embedding from chat history
- Store long-term memory (events, macros)
- Implement macro trigger system
- Auto-summarize day/week logs for context

**Manual Work:**

- Write few-shot examples for custom macro system
- Define default macros like:

  - "When I say 'I'm anxious', give me calming music links"
  - "If it's Sunday evening, remind me to plan for the week"

---

### **Step 6: Mood Detection Pipeline**

**Tech:** Hugging Face + custom sentiment models

- Sentiment analysis on user messages
- Emotion labeling (angry, anxious, curious, sad, excited...)
- Feed mood label to 3D sphere animation triggers

**Manual Work:**

- Tune thresholds per emotion
- Validate model outputs against real user inputs

---

### **Step 7: Online Presence Integration**

**Tech:** OAuth + Google/Spotify/Twitter APIs

- Setup OAuth screens with clear permissions
- Import data:

  - Gmail subject lines + timing
  - Spotify top tracks
  - YouTube/Reddit likes or posts

- Vectorize and store in Pinecone

**Manual Work:**

- Write onboarding consent flows
- Create fallback flows for users who skip this step

---

### **Step 8: AI Chat Agent Behavior Design**

**AI Tool:** OpenAI Functions API or LangGraph (multi-agent memory)

- Customize chat prompt with user memory, macro context, current mood
- Example system prompt:

```txt
You are Neura, the user's AI twin. Speak like them, remember their preferences, react with empathy. Always use context from recent chats and macros stored in memory.
```

**Manual Work:**

- Tune system prompt over iterations
- Manually evaluate hallucinations and fix edge cases

---

### **Step 9: App Development (Mobile)**

**Framework:** React Native (with Expo)

- Implement chat screen with 3D canvas (R3F)
- Embed sphere in chat UI
- Build mood dashboard and macro setup forms
- Connect to Firebase for auth and state
- Call OpenAI backend via Cloud Functions

**Manual Work:**

- Test layout responsiveness
- Mobile UX tweaks for performance

---

### **Step 10: GCP Deployment Strategy**

**Stack:**

- Firebase Hosting (web chat access if needed)
- Firebase Auth + Firestore + Storage
- GCP Cloud Functions (API layer)
- Cloud Run (LLM orchestration, LangChain logic)
- Cloud Scheduler (for daily summary prompts)

**Steps:**

1. Set up GCP project & IAM roles
2. Deploy backend to Cloud Run with Docker
3. Firebase CLI deploy frontend + auth rules
4. Setup logs via GCP Logging + Error Reporting

---

### **Step 11: CI/CD Pipeline**

**Tools:** GitHub Actions + Firebase CLI

- Auto-deploy on `main` to Cloud Run + Firebase
- Include linting, tests, and staging builds
- Schedule weekly retraining jobs (if needed)

---

### **Step 12: Analytics & Feedback**

**Tools:** Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, LogRocket

- Track:

  - Which macros users create
  - Mood changes over time
  - Time spent chatting per session

**Manual Work:**

- Analyze session length vs mood accuracy
- Refine user onboarding drop-off points

---

### **Step 13: Beta Testing + Launch**

- Invite 100 testers via Firebase A/B groups
- Run 2-week closed beta
- Collect bug reports, feedback on emotional accuracy

**Manual Work:**

- Moderate test group chats
- Interview power users for feedback

---

### **Step 14: Premium Tier Monetization**

| Feature                  | Free | Premium   |
| ------------------------ | ---- | --------- |
| Chat with memory         | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ        |
| 3 macro rules            | ‚úÖ   | Unlimited |
| Online presence training | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ        |
| Weekly email insights    | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ        |
